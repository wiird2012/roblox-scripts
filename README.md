# roblox-scripts
Collection of the scripts I published.

Scripts in archives subfolder are either: not mine and/or old
Avoid using scripts from there.

## I'll be making this read-only because I want to lower my interaction on Roblox as a whole, specially after they're forcing everyone to age verify to access basic communication features within 2026. I do not want to play on the next equivalent of (what is going to be) Facebook.
Temporarily unarchived as I'm going to develop and upload more scripts for few games, until I fully quit Roblox
